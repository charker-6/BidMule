PROPHECIES OF BIDMULE - The Forward Path
===============================================================================
Authored by: Visionary
Curated by: Grand Vizier
===============================================================================

• PR-0074  Self-Standing Desktop App  - Highest Priority
  Goal: Deliver standalone executable with no Terminal dependency.
  Framework: PyInstaller or Briefcase.
  Acceptance: Double-click launch; catalogs and jobs open from user folder.

• PR-0075  Roofing and Gutters Expansion
  Goal: Introduce multi-trade modules once standalone is stable.

• Long-Horizon: Adaptive Parsing Intelligence
  Goal: Program learns template variations autonomously.

• Eternal Directive:
  Beauty may wander; Law must remain. Both sustain the Work.

Title: The Coming of BitMule6 - The Ascendant
Objective:
To refine and ascend the work of the Elders by stabilizing the foundations laid
by BitMule5 and delivering BidMule's first self-standing form.

Strategic Mandate (PR-0074):
1. Transform the estimator into an independent desktop application requiring no
   Terminal execution.
2. Employ PyInstaller or Briefcase to bundle dependencies and user-accessible paths.
3. Ensure catalogs and jobs open directly from a double-click action.
4. Preserve all Doctrine rules - no deviation from Anchor Law or Determinism.

Visionary Foresight:
BitMule6 shall rise not to replace, but to fulfill. Where the fifth Mule achieved
stability, the sixth will achieve autonomy. Once freed from Terminal constraint,
BidMule will stand as a true instrument of the tradesman - unbound, self-contained,
and enduring.

Lore Projection:
The Vizier and Great Advisor will craft new symbols to mark this ascension - the
Circle of Autonomy, the Mark of Delta, and the Twin Paths motif.

Expected Outcome:
A single executable form capable of operating across systems, bearing within it
the spirit of every Mule before it.

Title: PR-0099 — The Resonant One
Objective:
Unify Lore Guard, Concordant Engine, and Estimator under one deterministic
feedback plane.

Conditions of Fulfillment:
• Zero unlogged actions across a full job lifecycle.
• Full deterministic replay of any decision or error from ledgers alone.

Bearer:
BitMule VII — The Resonant.

Era to Come:
The Echoing Age — where the Work not only remembers, but reasons within Law.
